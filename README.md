# 🧩 Modules

### 1️⃣ Logistic Regression  
Predicts heart disease risk using the Framingham Heart Study dataset.  
- Implemented from scratch.  
- Visualizations: loss function trend, predicted probabilities, and confusion matrix.  
- Demonstrates binary classification and feature scaling.

### 2️⃣ Neural Network Classifier (MNIST)  
Classifies handwritten digits (0–9) using a dense neural network.  
- Built with TensorFlow / Keras.  
- Displays model accuracy, training progress, and sample predictions.  
- Shows fundamental deep learning workflow (data preprocessing → training → evaluation).

### 3️⃣ Recommender System  
Predicts movie ratings using user and movie embeddings with neural network.  
- Based on collaborative filtering principles.  
- Visualizes predicted ratings and top recommendations for each user.  
- Demonstrates how neural networks can model nonlinear user–item interactions.
